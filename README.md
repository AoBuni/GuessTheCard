# CardGuessGame
Guess the other player's card and win

There are two players and the game is played by turns.

Player's cards are given randomly. 
First Player A shows one of their card (random) to Player B. Player B guesses whether his/her card is higher or lower than Player A. Player B does not know his/her card's value before guessing.

If Player B guessed right, he wins and gets a score of 1, otherwise same applies for Player A.

Now Player B shows one of his/her card to Player A.

Game continues until each person guessed three times.

The player with the most score wins.
